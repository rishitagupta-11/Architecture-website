Each project is presented in its own dedicated page, highlighting the design concept, construction details, and the firm's role in the project's execution. Users can navigate through the portfolio using pagination or a dynamic grid layout.

A dedicated contact page is essential for users to reach out to the firm for inquiries or collaborations. It should include a contact form for visitors to submit their messages, as well as the firm's contact information, including phone numbers, email addresses, and physical address. Integration with mapping services, such as Google Maps, can provide directions to the firm's office location.
